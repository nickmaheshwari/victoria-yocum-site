                  I attended the <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://hsc.unm.edu/medicine/departments/biochemistry/"> University of New Mexico (UNM) </a>  from 2014 to 2020. I began my college education my second year of high school while I was enrolled in dual credit courses, allowing me to obtain a year’s worth of credits before graduating. UNM is a comprehensive, Carnegie-designated Research 1 University, and is the nation’s only flagship state university that is also a Hispanic Serving Institution. Additionally, the UNM Biochemistry program is one of the few in the U.S. that is centered in a School of Medicine. While in college, I simultaneously interned at the <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://unmhealth.org/services/development-disabilities/programs/early-childhood-programs/echfs/focus.html"> FOCUS Early-Intervention Program </a> through UNM Hospital, gaining knowledge working with children who have developmental delay or are at risk of experiencing delay due to trauma and crisis. Furthermore, I became a co-author for a meta-analysis research article analyzing the cognitive outcomes of young infants after prenatal exposure to medications for opioid-use disorder.

                  During my senior year of my undergraduate studies I had the opportunity to study abroad in Granada, Spain at the Centro de Lenguas Modernas, a leading institution in teaching Spanish language and culture. While there, I was part of the intensive Spanish language and culture program, through which I learned about the different culture, adapted to new ideas and cultural expectations, and enhanced my written and oral communication skills of the Spanish language. I was also able to shadow in the local hospital for a short period of time while simultaneously researching disparities in the healthcare systems of the U.S. and Spain. This experience working with a variegated group of patients in a vastly different clinical setting allowed me to better understand diverse cultures, and provided me with an overall cross-cultural perspective of healthcare.

                  The division of community behavioral health partners with New Mexico communities, national stakeholders, and UNM collaborators to address behavioral health disparities through health services research and evaluation, and through increasing access to quality behavioral health services that are holistic, cost-effective and provided with respect to unique cultures within New Mexico communities. The particular research project conducted was studying the effectivity of the UNM FOCUS Program (See “University of New Mexico FOCUS Program”), and the possibility of expanding the program to better help the community of patients and providers affected by substance-use disorder and trauma, as well as their families. At CBH, I was responsible for conducting on-site data collection, including administering semi-structured interviews with patients within an established research protocol. I performed data-entry, and created the study survey using the computer-based data entry program REDCap, which I became fluent in using. Furthermore, I transcribed interviews with patients and providers and created tables/graphs to represent the data. While this particular study is waiting to be b, we are already working on the next project- an effort to expand comprehensive medication-assisted treatment (MAT), including psychosocial services, for opioid use disorders (OUD) to adult parents of young children (ages 0-6). This is an expansion of the promising practices already in use in the FOCUS clinic.

                  <p>
                 The Office of the Medical Investigator (OMI) directs all death-related investigative activities in the State of New Mexico, examining any death that is sudden, violent, untimely, unexpected, or where a person is found dead and the cause of death is unknown. As a special program of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, the OMI also provides advanced forensic pathology instruction to residents, fellows, and numerous University classes related to forensic investigation and medical education. The Radiology-Pathology Center for Forensic Imaging (CFI), at the UNM School of Medicine is located within the OMI, and is currently the only forensic center in the United States with in-house computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities, which support forensic research and education, and the clinical service of the OMI. As a result of this all autopsy services are conducted in Albuquerque in a state-of-the-art facility, which is considered to be the best in the country. I began working at OMI during my undergraduate studies, where I was a Student Morphology Technician. This involved me assisting with the conduct of the autopsy, preparing and completing autopsy paperwork/data entry, supporting the maintenance of the lab by ensuring equipment/supplies are stocked, and familiarizing myself with autopsy chemicals, instruments and equipment.
                 <br><br>
                 After 3 months working as a Student Morphology Technician, my role was expanded and I quickly transitioned into a full-time Morphology Technician. I was responsible for conducting the prosection and evisceration process and assisting in training resident physicians in autopsy procedures. I provided technical morphology lab services for hospital, forensic, or anatomical autopsy cases, and general support to pathologists and other technical staff. Additionally, I performed sensitive computer data entry, and prepared applicable reports and autopsy paperwork for each case. I became proficient in practicing safety and environmental/infectious control methods, including becoming acquainted with COVID-19 safety procedures. Through this role, I have acquired vast hands-on knowledge of anatomy and pathology, and a familiarity working in a high-stress, fast-paced environment.

                 The New Mexico Simon Scholars Program is an especially unique scholarship program designed to address some of the challenges that economically disadvantaged, first generation college-bound students from New Mexico face in pursuing a four-year college degree. The program is designed to help traditionally underrepresented students attain a college degree. My role as a Simon’s Scholar Tutor requires me to support and mentor high school students (scholars), and serve as a resource for scholars and their families as they navigate through the college transition process. Tutors provide networking skills and etiquette training, academic support, leadership training and community service opportunities. Furthermore, Scholars are also provided with an intensive college preparatory program, which includes ACT and SAT courses, college tours and assistance in the college application process. Working with this diverse population of students, many of whom have immigrant parents and come from disadvantaged communities, provided me with valuable experience as a leader and mentor and an opportunity to ultimately help these students and their families accomplish their life goals and dreams.

                 The FOCUS Early Intervention Program provides specialized supports and services for families of children aged birth to three years old, specifically children who have developmental delay or are at risk of experiencing delay due to family substance use, family violence, trauma, prenatal exposure to substances, etc. FOCUS strives to improve family well-being by strengthening family capacity to support resilience and protective behaviors for their children, providing culturally sensitive service strategies, collaborating with the community, and maximizing access to quality services. Through my research on young infants who experience prenatal exposure to medications for opioid-use disorder, I had the opportunity to intern with the program. I worked closely with the Early Intervention specialists to provide general medical care in a clinical setting, as well as social work services through home-visits. Additionally, I worked with the UNM ADOBE Program, which provides wrap-around services for youths that have been incarcerated in the Bernalillo County Youth Services Center(YSC), and with the UNM Milagro Program, New Mexico's first comprehensive prenatal care program for pregnant women with substance use disorders. This also allowed me to shadow in obstetrics and family medicine practices. The internship provided me with vast knowledge on early-intervention work, and substance-use disorders. It changed my view on addiction, trauma, and mental health, and ultimately inspired me to continue to make an impact in this community.

			      <h4>Abstract</h4>
			      <p>Importance  The number of children with prenatal opioid exposure to medication for addiction treatment (MAT) with methadone and buprenorphine for maternal opioid use disorder is increasing, but the associations of this exposure with cognitive outcomes are not well understood.<br><br>Objective  To examine the strength and consistency of findings in the medical literature regarding the association of prenatal exposure to MAT with early childhood cognitive development, particularly when accounting for variables outside MAT exposure.<br><br>Data Sources  A search strategy obtained publications from PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase from January 1972 to June 2019. Reference lists from identified articles were searched.<br><br>Study Selection  Inclusion criteria were cohort studies, studies including children aged 1 to 60 months with at least 2 months of prenatal MAT exposure, studies using standardized direct-observation testing scales, and studies reporting means and SDs. Case reports, case series, historical controls, and reviews were excluded.
