                  <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://www.heliosmi.com/"> Helios MI </a>is a quantitative trading fund that focuses on using the newest software innovations to maximize the returns of derivatives trading. At HeliosMI, I use Java and C# to design algorithmic stock and option trading strategies, connecting to Interactive Broker's API. I also collaborate in the development of the entire trading framework, and assist with the formulation of several trading strategies, researching and building a strong foundation in stocks, options, and the inner workings of financial markets. I also acquired a much deeper knowledge of Java and it's ecosystem including Spring Boot, Maven, JUnit, Hibernate, etc. In the past, I have back-tested stock trading algorithms using QuantConnect, mainly using C# and Python (also see, Stock Trading Quantified in my <a class="smoothscroll" href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a>), and back-tested option trading strategies using Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation, utilizing their paper-trading capabilities. I also have identified potential bugs and system improvements using JUnit tests and collaborated in the design of the underlying Order Entry system. This system is used throughout the company to communicate with the brokerage (Interactive Brokers). Finally, I used HTML and Jekyll to design the current iteration of the company website (see above), and used Netlify and AWS (Route 53, S3) to deploy the site to the company domain.

                 Having just finished my undergraduate degree I was working for the real estate brokerage startup <a class = "smoothscroll" href = "https://asherchaim.com/"> Asher Chaim </a>as a junior software engineer. I was tasked with designing and building the company's website, and with exactly zero web dev experience, I accepted. In just 2 weeks I taught myself HTML and CSS and had a basic website deployed (via Digital Ocean). In the weeks that followed I added web forms with spam/bot detection, data collection routing directly to an external CRM as contacts, and moved the website’s deployment to Netlify (for Github support and simpler deployments). Today my project is still the primary company site. In my free time during this project I designed a few logos for the company, mostly for fun, one of which was picked as the company's primary logo. For all of these efforts I was promoted to full stack software engineer, where I am currently tasked with building company applications (typically in Java and Python), implementing new web features, onboarding new employees, and integrating said employees into the company tech-stack.

			      <h4>Abstract</h4>
			      <p>Importance  The number of children with prenatal opioid exposure to medication for addiction treatment (MAT) with methadone and buprenorphine for maternal opioid use disorder is increasing, but the associations of this exposure with cognitive outcomes are not well understood.<br><br>Objective  To examine the strength and consistency of findings in the medical literature regarding the association of prenatal exposure to MAT with early childhood cognitive development, particularly when accounting for variables outside MAT exposure.<br><br>Data Sources  A search strategy obtained publications from PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase from January 1972 to June 2019. Reference lists from identified articles were searched.<br><br>Study Selection  Inclusion criteria were cohort studies, studies including children aged 1 to 60 months with at least 2 months of prenatal MAT exposure, studies using standardized direct-observation testing scales, and studies reporting means and SDs. Case reports, case series, historical controls, and reviews were excluded.
